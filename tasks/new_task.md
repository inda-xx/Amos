### üéÆ Assignment

Our adventure begins with coding a simple space exploration game. Fly through space, dodge enemies, and collect points. Below are the exercises that will guide you in building the game's functionalities.

#### Exercise 3.0 -- Fields

Create a class `SpaceExplorer.java` in your `src` directory. You'll be implementing fields to model the player and game dynamics.

- `String` playerName
- `int` score
- `double` positionX
- `double` positionY
- `boolean` collisionOccurred

If implemented correctly, adding the main method from Example 1 should compile when added to `SpaceExplorer.java`.

<details>
  <summary> üõ† Example 1 </summary>

  ```java
  class SpaceExplorer {

    // Declare your fields here!

    public static void main(String[] args) {
      SpaceExplorer hero = new SpaceExplorer();

      // Initialize fields
      hero.playerName = "Captain Star";
      hero.score = 0;
      hero.positionX = 100.0;
      hero.positionY = 200.0;

      // Output the player's information
      System.out.println("Player: " + hero.playerName);
      System.out.println("Score: " + hero.score);
      System.out.println("Position: (" + hero.positionX + ", " + hero.positionY + ")");
    }
  }
  ```
</details>

#### Exercise 3.1 -- Getters and Setters

Encapsulate the data by making fields private. Implement *getters* and *setters* to access them. 

<details>
  <summary> üõ† Example 2 </summary>

  ```java
  class SpaceExplorer {

    // Add private fields and getters/setters!

    public static void main(String[] args) {
      SpaceExplorer hero = new SpaceExplorer();

      hero.setPlayerName("Captain Star");
      hero.setScore(0);
      hero.setPositionX(100.0);
      hero.setPositionY(200.0);

      System.out.println("Player: " + hero.getPlayerName());
      System.out.println("Score: " + hero.getScore());
      System.out.println("Position: (" + hero.getPositionX() + ", " + hero.getPositionY() + ")");
      System.out.println("Collision Status: " + hero.isCollisionOccurred());
    }
  }
  ```
</details>

> **Note:** The getter for the `boolean` collisionOccurred would be `isCollisionOccurred()`.

#### Exercise 3.2 -- Constructor

A constructor simplifies initialization. Design a constructor for initializing the `SpaceExplorer`.

- Constructor should accept player name, initial position, and starting score.

Deploy the updated fields via constructor and conduct tests akin to Example 2.

#### Exercise 3.3 -- Scoring System

Implement a `scorePoints` method to update the player's score. Reflect these changes in the terminal using `printInfo()`.

<details>
  <summary> üõ† Example 3 </summary>

  ```java
  public static void main(String[] args){
    SpaceExplorer hero = new SpaceExplorer("Captain Star", 100.0, 200.0, 0);

    // Scoring points
    hero.scorePoints(50);

    // Print updated score
    hero.printInfo();
  }
  ```

  Expected output:

  ```
  > Space Explorer: Captain Star.
  > Score: 50
  > Position: (100.0, 200.0)
  > Collision Status: false
  ```
</details>

#### Exercise 3.4 -- Enemy Interactions

Introduce the `encounterEnemy` method to simulate an interaction with an enemy. If an enemy is 'hit', set `collisionOccurred` to true and reduce the score based on a defined formula.

<details>
  <summary> üõ† Example 4 </summary>

  ```java
  public static void main(String[] args){
    SpaceExplorer hero = new SpaceExplorer("Captain Star", 100.0, 200.0, 50);
    hero.encounterEnemy(10);

    hero.printInfo();
  }
  ```

  Expected output:

  ```
  > Space Explorer: Captain Star attacked by an enemy!
  > Score reduced by 10, new score: 40
  > Collision Status: true
  ```
</details>

#### Exercise 3.5 -- Variable Shadowing

Explore the *Variable Shadowing* phenomenon in Java. Understand key concepts that affect variable accessibility within different scopes.

```Java
public class SpaceError {
    private int speed = 100;

    public void printSpeed() {
        int speed = 200;
        System.out.println(speed); // Outputs the wrong speed level!
    }

    public static void main(String[] args){
        new SpaceError().printSpeed();
    }
}
```

Here is another example of shadowing:

```Java
public class Starship {
  private String shipName;
  private double fuelLevel;

  public Starship(String shipName, double fuelLevel) {
    shipName = shipName; // This is incorrect.
    fuelLevel = fuelLevel;
  }

  public void fuelUpdate(){
    double fuelLevel = 50;
    System.out.println("Current fuel level: " + fuelLevel); // Outputs an unintended value.
  }
}
```

> **Note:** Pay attention to the difference between local and instance scopes and how the `this` keyword can help.
