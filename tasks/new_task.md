### üèõ Assignment

Welcome to your game design task! You will be implementing a simple game using Java that features a player character interacting in a world filled with challenges and adversaries.

#### Exercise 1.0 -- Designing the Player Character
First, you will create a class for the player character in your game. Open your IDE and create a new Java class called `Player.java`. The player should have:

- `String` name
- `int` score
- `int` xPosition
- `int` yPosition

Make sure these fields are private and implement appropriate *getters* and *setters* for them.

<details>
  <summary> üõ† Player Example </summary>

  ```java
  public class Player {

      // Instance fields
      private String name;
      private int score;
      private int xPosition;
      private int yPosition;

      // Constructor
      public Player(String name, int xPosition, int yPosition) {
          this.name = name;
          this.xPosition = xPosition;
          this.yPosition = yPosition;
          this.score = 0; // Initial score
      }

      // Getters and Setters
      public String getName() { return name; }
      public void setName(String name) { this.name = name; }
      public int getScore() { return score; }
      public void setScore(int score) { this.score = score; }
      public int getxPosition() { return xPosition; }
      public void setxPosition(int xPosition) { this.xPosition = xPosition; }
      public int getyPosition() { return yPosition; }
      public void setyPosition(int yPosition) { this.yPosition = yPosition; }

      // Method to print player info
      public void printInfo() {
          System.out.println("Player: " + name);
          System.out.println("Score: " + score);
          System.out.println("Position: (" + xPosition + ", " + yPosition + ")");
      }
  }
  ```
</details>

#### Exercise 1.1 -- Creating Enemy Characters
Now design an `Enemy` class. Each enemy should encapsulate:

- `String` type
- `int` xPosition
- `int` yPosition

Create this class as you did with the `Player` class, including a constructor, and *getters* and *setters*.

<details>
  <summary> üõ† Enemy Example </summary>

  ```java
  public class Enemy {

      // Instance fields
      private String type;
      private int xPosition;
      private int yPosition;

      // Constructor
      public Enemy(String type, int xPosition, int yPosition) {
          this.type = type;
          this.xPosition = xPosition;
          this.yPosition = yPosition;
      }

      // Getters and Setters
      public String getType() { return type; }
      public void setType(String type) { this.type = type; }
      public int getxPosition() { return xPosition; }
      public void setxPosition(int xPosition) { this.xPosition = xPosition; }
      public int getyPosition() { return yPosition; }
      public void setyPosition(int yPosition) { this.yPosition = yPosition; }

      // Method to print enemy info
      public void printInfo() {
          System.out.println("Enemy Type: " + type);
          System.out.println("Position: (" + xPosition + ", " + yPosition + ")");
      }
  }
  ```
</details>

#### Exercise 1.2 -- Player Movement
Implement logic within the `Player` class to move the player character. Add methods `moveUp()`, `moveDown()`, `moveLeft()`, and `moveRight()` to change the player's `xPosition` and `yPosition`.

#### Exercise 1.3 -- Scoring System
In the `Player` class, add the `increaseScore(int points)` method. This method should allow the player's score to be increased when certain conditions are met (e.g., when the player encounters an enemy).

#### Exercise 1.4 -- Enemy Interaction
Implement a method in the `Game` class that handles interactions when a player meets an enemy. You may decide the interaction logic‚Äîe.g., if the player is "attacked," deduct points; if the player "defeats" the enemy, increase points.

#### Exercise 1.5 -- Building the Game
Create a `Game` class with a `main` method. Initialize player and enemy instances, and simulate a simple scenario where the player moves and interacts with the enemy, updating their score accordingly.

<details>
  <summary> üõ† Game Main Method Example </summary>

  ```java
  public class Game {
      public static void main(String[] args) {
          // Create player and enemy instances
          Player player = new Player("Hero", 0, 0);
          Enemy enemy = new Enemy("Goblin", 1, 0);

          // Simulate player movement
          player.moveRight();
          player.printInfo();

          // Simulate interaction with enemy
          if (player.getxPosition() == enemy.getxPosition() && player.getyPosition() == enemy.getyPosition()) {
              System.out.println("Encountered an enemy!");
              // Implement interaction logic here (e.g., player fights enemy).
              player.increaseScore(10); // Example interaction
          }

          // Print final state
          player.printInfo();
          enemy.printInfo();
      }
  }
  ```
</details>

#### Exercise 1.6 -- Variable Shadowing
Explore variable shadowing with a small example. Understand how to fix it by properly using the `this` keyword in your game classes.

```Java
public class VariableShadowExample {
    private int number = 10;

    public void showNumber() {
        int number = 5; // Shadows instance variable
        System.out.println(this.number); // Correctly prints the instance variable
    }

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        new VariableShadowExample().showNumber(); // Should print 10
    }
}
```
